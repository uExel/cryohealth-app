{{ONE_LINE_WHAT_THIS_REPO_IS_FOR — the purpose, not the stack; the stack is visible in the tree}}

## Working here
- Start sessions with /uexel:orient, end with /uexel:handoff. Pipeline:
  orient → plan → gate → build → verify → report → handoff (docs: uExel/cryo-harness).
- Task state lives in GitHub issues — labels + milestones, no boards.
- Shared AI working files: docs/ai/ (PLAN, TODO, HANDOFF, LEARNINGS, sessions, decisions).

## Map
<!-- One line per top-level folder whose purpose a newcomer can't infer from its name.
     Delete rows that are obvious — every line here loads in every session. -->
- {{DIR}} — {{WHY_IT_EXISTS}}

## Gotchas
<!-- Only repo-wide traps that bite in ANY directory. Local conventions and test/lint
     commands go in that directory's own CLAUDE.md. Date rules that exist to work around
     a current limitation: "added YYYY-MM for <x> — re-evaluate on next model release". -->

## gstack (REQUIRED — global install)

**Before doing ANY work, verify gstack is installed:**

```bash
test -d ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin && echo "GSTACK_OK" || echo "GSTACK_MISSING"
```

If GSTACK_MISSING: STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> gstack is required for all AI-assisted work in this repo.
> Install it:
> ```bash
> git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack
> cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --team
> ```
> Then restart your AI coding tool.

Do not skip skills, ignore gstack errors, or work around missing gstack.

Using gstack skills: After install, skills like /qa, /ship, /review, /investigate,
and /browse are available. Use /browse for all web browsing.
Use ~/.claude/skills/gstack/... for gstack file paths (the global path).

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
